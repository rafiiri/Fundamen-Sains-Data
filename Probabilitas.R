###Binomial Random Variable###


###
### For example, You roll a fair die 75 times
### X is the number of times you get a six/6
###and the probability of success is 1/6 in each of the 75 trials.
### What is the probability
### that we get X = 6 success out of 75 trials?

dbinom(x = 6, size = 75, prob = 1/6)
